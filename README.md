## 🚀 About The Project

This is an interactive web application designed to visualize how various sorting algorithms work in real-time. Unlike standard visualizers, this project includes a **Voice Assistant** that narrates the sorting process, explaining comparisons and swaps as they happen.

The application features a modern, dark-themed UI with neon accents, customizable array inputs, and real-time complexity analysis.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **8 Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, Counting, and Tim Sort.
- **🗣️ Voice Assistant:** Built-in Text-to-Speech engine that narrates step-by-step operations (Comparisons, Swaps, Merges).
- **Customizable Controls:** Adjust array size and sorting speed dynamically.
- **Custom Input:** Users can input their own comma-separated values to visualize specific cases.
- **Real-Time Complexity:** Displays Time (Best, Average, Worst) and Space complexity for the selected algorithm.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive dark mode design with glowing neon controls.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, Animations)
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **No External Libraries:** Built entirely from scratch to demonstrate core DOM manipulation and algorithm logic.
